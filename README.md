## üåü Project Overview

This is a fast-paced, top-down 2D shooter developed using **Pygame**, drawing inspiration from the  world of Eiichiro Oda's *One Piece*. Players assume the role of a protagonist, navigating a dynamically generated environment while engaging in combat against waves of themed adversaries.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- Sprite animation  
- Collision detection  
- Object-oriented design  
- Efficient asset and memory management

## üöÄ Technical Highlights

- **Game Engine:** Developed from scratch using the **Pygame** library  
- **Modular Design:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach with distinct classes for all major components (`Player`, `Enemy`, `Bullet`, `Gun`, etc.)  
- **Asset Management:** Dynamic loading system using `os.path.join` and `os.walk` with error handling for missing assets  
- **Tile-Map Integration:** Levels created using **Pytmx** to load `.tmx` maps from Tiled Map Editor  
- **Collision System:** Sprite-based detection using `pygame.sprite.spritecollide` and pixel-perfect masks  
- **Custom Events:** Timed enemy spawning with `pygame.event.custom_type` and `pygame.time.set_timer`  
- **User Interface:** Interactive menus, dynamic health bar, and real-time scoring  
- **Dynamic Camera:** Smooth scrolling camera centered on the player using an offset-based system
